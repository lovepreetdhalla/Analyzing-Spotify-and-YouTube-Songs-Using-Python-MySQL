# Analyzing-Spotify-and-YouTube-Songs-Using-Python-MySQL
Data science project - Analyzing Spotify and YouTube Songs Using Python &amp; MySQL

# Project Description

This project helped us understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using Python for better upcoming performance, how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database

The Project will consist of 2 modules:

Module 1: Data Pre-processing data using Python

Module 2: Analyzing data using SQL

# Data Source

Data was provided by HiCounselor.

# Data Analysis Concepts Utilized In This Project

Data Preprocessing Using Python Programming and connecting to Database :

• Droping unnecessary columns <br />
• Droping null values<br />
• Droping duplicate values<br />
• Data type conversion<br />
• Renaming the column<br />
• Droping records which starts with special characters<br />
• Creating new column on the basis of some conditions<br />
• Saving newly cleaned dataset into csv file format<br />
• Converting dataframe into SQL Table, Uploading Table into phpmyadmin server and solving queries.<br />

 Using SQL Queries To Solve Problem Statements :

• Aggregating the data<br />
• Grouping the data<br />
• Ordering the data<br />
• Using addition of two columns to show as a calculated column<br />
