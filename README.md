# Analyzing-Spotify-and-YouTube-Songs-Using-Python-MySQL
Data science project - Analyzing Spotify and YouTube Songs Using Python &amp; MySQL

# Project Description

This project helped us understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using Python for better upcoming performance, how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database

The Project will consist of 2 modules:

Module 1: Data Pre-processing data using Python

Module 2: Analyzing data using SQL

# Data Source

# Data Analysis Concepts Utilized In This Project

Data Preprocessing Using Python Programming and connecting to Database :

Droping unnecessary columns
Droping null values
Droping duplicate values
Data type conversion
Renaming the column
Droping records which starts with special characters
Creating new column on the basis of some conditions
Saving newly cleaned dataset into csv file format
Converting dataframe into SQL Table, Uploading Table into phpmyadmin server and solving queries.
Using SQL Queries To Solve Problem Statements :

Aggregating the data
Grouping the data
Ordering the data
Using addition of two columns to show as a calculated column
